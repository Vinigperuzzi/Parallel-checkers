At the end of the script you will have installed in you operational system the pyenv (in case you do not already have), with all it's
depedencies and with python global version set to 3.11.0 and setting the aproprietated environment variables.
It will also set the venv for the project folder and install all requirements for the project to run.
And at the end, it will call a make file to compile the file.c to a Shared Lib and then you are able to run checkers.py.
In case you do not want to install pyenv cause you already have python and wish to change version to 3.11.0 manually, you
do not need to run this bash.sh, you can just run >pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n"
